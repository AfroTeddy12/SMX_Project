# React Dependency Fix Documentation

## 🐛 Issue Resolved

### Problem
The frontend was experiencing dependency conflicts when trying to install packages:
- React 19.1.0 was incompatible with `react-simple-maps@3.0.0`
- `ajv` module resolution errors occurred with legacy peer deps
- `react-scripts` was not recognized due to missing node_modules

### Root Cause
- `react-simple-maps` version 3.0.0 only supports React versions up to 18.x
- React 19.1.0 introduced breaking changes that affected compatibility
- The project needed a stable, compatible React version

## ✅ Solution Applied

### React Version Downgrade
- **From**: React 19.1.0 and React DOM 19.1.0
- **To**: React 18.2.0 and React DOM 18.2.0
- **Reason**: Full compatibility with all project dependencies

### Files Modified
1. **`frontend/package.json`**
   - Updated React version from `^19.1.0` to `^18.2.0`
   - Updated React DOM version from `^19.1.0` to `^18.2.0`
   - Added documentation comment explaining the version choice

2. **`frontend/package-lock.json`**
   - Regenerated with React 18.2.0 dependency tree
   - Resolved all peer dependency conflicts

## 🔧 Installation Process

### Clean Installation
```bash
cd frontend
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
Remove-Item package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Verification
```bash
npm start
# Should start without errors on http://localhost:3000
```
